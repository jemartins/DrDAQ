DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

In the pendulum experiment the
interface must read the oscilation angle. For this purpose the pendulum is
attached to an axis that rotates a couple of magnets around a hall effect 
sensor, providing a voltage which is proportional to the sin of the oscilation 
angle. The student has to set the pendulum in the vertical position and at 
a fixed angle to provide two calibration points in order to convert the 
voltage readings into degrees of oscilation. 
What has to be done:
a- modify the GUI to include an option for the pendulum sensor, to colect
two calibration parameters and to pass them on to PicoReader.
b- PicoReader must pass the calibration parameters to PicoMgr.
c- A function readAngle must be constructed in PicoMgr to convert voltage readings into angle.
