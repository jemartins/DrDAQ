** DrDAQ Application Project

****************************

============
Introduction:
============

DrDAQ is projected to read all the sensors of the DrDAQ device and plot them in
the Grace window. By now the program is capable to read two sensors simultaneously and convert to the units of the Temperature, Light, Sound Level and Voltage. 
Waveform, Resistance and pH are read directly from units of ADC.

==============
prerequisites:
==============

    You need to have in your system:
 
    1. Tcl, Tcl-devel and Tk

    2. gcc and gcc-c++

    3. grace and grace-devel.
    
    4. For newer versions of "SIMPL", "SIMPL Tcl" and "SIMPL unit test scripts". 
       Transfer to the address http://www.icanprogram.com/simpl/. 

       Untar and follow all the instructions of the installation from the file 
       INSTALL.simpl. Don't forget to create correctly all the environment 
       variables. 
    
    5. Driver of DrDAQ for linux supplied by Picotech.
       
	You can find sources of driver for differents kernel version on
	picoDriver directory. See README.TXT to compile and install correctly
	the module picopar.ko and create /dev/picopar#.

    6. Standard installation of the SWIG. 
       The binary file  swig must have do in /usr/bin/ directory

       
============
Installation:
============

    1. Untar the drdaq.tar.gz in a preference fold. 

       Lets assume you are going to install it in your HOME directory:

	$ cd $HOME
    	$ tar -zxvf drdaq.tar.gz 
    	$ cd drdaq
	$ make
    	$ make install
 
    2. Create the environment variables down listed. Normally you can do it
       inserting the following line in your ~/.bash_profile:
    
    	export DRDAQ_HOME=$HOME/drdaq
    	export TEST_HOME=$DRDAQ_HOME
    	PATH=$PATH:$DRDAQ_HOME/scripts
    
        Note: 
        From the installation of the SIMPL, probably you have the following lines
        in your ~/.bash_profile. (If not, is time to insert them):
        
        export SIMPL_HOME=$HOME/simpl
        export FIFO_PATH=$SIMPL_HOME/fifo
        PATH=$PATH:$SIMPL_HOME/scripts
        
        Hint: 
        To do the changing in the ~/bash_profile, type the command:
        
        $ source ~/.bash_profile

=========
Execution:
=========

	To run the test-unit from DrDAQ type:
    
	$ cd $DRDAQ_HOME
	
    	(for kernel 2.4)
    	$ dotest b004
    	
    	(for kernel 2.6)
    	$ dotest j004
    	
    	There are other test-units you can utilize. 
        There are in the directory $DRDAQ_HOME/testing

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   You can directly run DrDAQ from the script $DRDAQ_HOME/bin/drdaq. Before
   you need to edit this script making right DRDAQ_HOME and SIMPL_HOME 
   variables to reflect correctly your installation.
